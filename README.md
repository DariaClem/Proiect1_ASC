# Computer system architecture - Encryption and Decryption using XOR :computer:
**Assignment**: Write 2 python scripts encrypt.py / decrypt.py that take as parameter in command line a key and a file and XOR encrypt/decrypt using that key. The program will use the key to encrypt the content of the file.

# How to use
### Version: Python 3.9.9 :alien:
### Running program:
- python3 encript.py password input.txt output
- python3 decrypt.py output password input_recuperat.txt

# Second part of the project
### Our team: Cei _ sqrt(9) _ musafiri
### The opposing team: UTF-8 abuser ( https://github.com/EricMorosan/ProiectASC1 )
### Password: ASC_vrem_nota_10
- First project requirment: We XORed every character from a sequence from input.txt file with every character from a sequence from output file and we found out the password (An impediment in finding out the password was the fact that the other team exceeded the word limit). Both selected sequences were the same length and were selected from the begining of the files. We found out the key using parola.py, a script based on the previously stated idea. 
- Second project requirment: The second part of the project could not be solved because the text from input.txt was wrongly chosen. The text must be one from classical literature, not a sequence of numbers.
