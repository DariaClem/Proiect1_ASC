### Computer system architecture :computer: 
# Encryption and Decryption using XOR 
**Assignment**: Write 2 python scripts encrypt.py / decrypt.py that take as parameter in command line a key and a file and XOR encrypt/decrypt using that key. The program will use the key to encrypt the content of the file.

# How to use
### Version: Python 3.9.9 :alien:
### Running program:
``` 
python3 encript.py password input.txt output
python3 decrypt.py output password input_recuperat.txt
```
# Second part of the project
### Our team: Cei _ sqrt(9) _ musafiri
### The opposing team: UTF-8 abuser ( https://github.com/EricMorosan/ProiectASC1 )
### Password: ASC_vrem_nota_10
- First project requirement: We XORed every character from a sequence in the input.txt file with every character from a sequence in the output file to find the password. However, we encountered a difficulty in finding the password as the other team exceeded the word limit. Both selected sequences were of the same length and were chosen from the beginning of the files. We used parola.py, a script based on this idea, to find the key.
- Second project requirment: The second part of the project could not be completed because the text from input.txt was not appropriate. It should have been a text from classical literature, not a sequence of numbers.
